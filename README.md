# React Project Setup Guide

This guide will walk you through setting up your React project locally. Follow the steps below to get your development environment up and running.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your local machine:

- **Node.js** (v14.x or later): [Download and install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- **npm** (v6.x or later) or **yarn** (v1.x or later): npm is included with Node.js. To install yarn, follow the [yarn installation guide](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install).

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**

   First, clone the repository from GitHub to your local machine. Replace `<repository-url>` with the URL of your repository.

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>

2. **Install dependencies**

   Navigate to the project directory and install the necessary dependencies using npm or yarn.

   ```bash

   # Using npm
   npm install

   # Using yarn
   yarn install

3. **Start the development server**

    After installing the dependencies, start the development server.

    ```bash

    # Using npm
    npm start

    # Using yarn
    yarn start

    ```



    This command will run the app in development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits.



### Additional Scripts

Here are some additional scripts you might find useful:

 - Build the project

     ```bash

    # Using npm
    npm run build

    # Using yarn
    yarn build

    ```


    This will create an optimized production build of your app in the build folder.
